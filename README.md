# MDL-Assignments

The repo contains Assignments and a Project, as a part of the course Machine Data and Learning 2021.

## Assignments
- **A1: Bias and Variance**  
  Training mulitiple models with different polynomial dgrees, and finding the optimal degree by comparing the bias and variance for each case.
- **A2: Value Iteration and Markov Decision Process (MDP)**  
  - **Part 1**: Manual calculation for Value Iteration, using Bellman Update Equation.
  - **Part 2**: Finding optimal MDP policy by using Value Iteration algorithm and Bellman Update Equation. 
  - **Part 3**: Linear Programming.  
  Finding an optimal MDP policy by using `cvxpy` Linear Programming Solver python library.
- **A3: Belief States and Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)**
  - **Part 1**: Manual steps for Belief State calculation.
  - **Part 2**: Finding optimal POMDP policy by using [Sarsop](https://github.com/AdaCompNUS/sarsop) solver.

## Project
An implementation of **Genetic Algorithm** for manipulating sets of 11-dimensional vectors to optimally fit the training data.
